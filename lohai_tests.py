# the winner of the previous trick leads the next

# the player who plays the giver may give the trick to any player other than
# himself

# the recipient of a giver trick leads the next trick

# the player who plays the taker receives the trick

# A player who plays a mover who has the high or low count (or is tied for
# either) simply draws a new card from the deck

# A player who plays a mover who does not have the high or low count allows the
# player to immediately move a previously won trick from any player to any
# other.  Afterwards they draw a new card from the top of the deck.

# a player who plays a shaker can steal another players card, and the victim
# draws a card

# a player who plyas a shaker first simply draws a new card from the top of the
# deck

# At the end of the hand, the two players that have the least tricks (the Lo)
# and most tricks (the Hai) score points. If two or more players tie for either
# Lo or Hai, no players score those points.

# The person who reaches 1,500 points first wins the game. If two players reach
# 1,500 points in the same deal, the side with the higher score wins. If the
# two players are tied, both players win.

# If you play a red special card as the lead, the random card from the stack
# you put on top of it to replace it is the lead suit.

# If a black special card is played first, the next player is free to play
# whatever he would like. If he chooses to play a suited card, that is
# considered the lead suit.

# a player who plays a shaker can steal another players card, and the victim
# draws a card.  If the card is a shaker they can steal their call back

# if a player draws a giver or taker as a result of a shaker they trump
# previously played givers and takers


# FUTURE
# Three Player Lohai Instead of going for Hai or Lo, the objective is to be the
# player who is either the middle trick taker or the one who did not tie the
# other two players. Typically, this means each hand will have two players with
# three tricks and the scoring player with four tricks.
# 
# All rules are the same except 10 cards are dealt instead of 9 and the Mover
# only works if you are either Lo or Hai. If you are tied for either Lo or Hai,
# the Mover does not work.
